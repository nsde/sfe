## Info
We don't collect any sensitive data from our users, only the neccessary one.
The newest Releases always have the best privacy and security.

## Supported Versions

Our newest releases are the most safe ones:

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Release  | :white_check_mark: |
| Beta     | :x:                |
| Alpha    | :x:                |

Beta and Alpha versions are the most unstable ones, because they are under developement.
